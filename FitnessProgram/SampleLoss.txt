CALORIE NEEDS TO LOSE WEIGHT
----------------------------

If you want to lose fat, a useful guideline for lowering your calorie intake is to reduce your 
calories by at least 500, but not more than 1000 below your maintenance level. For people with 
only a small amount of weight to lose, 1000 calories is too much. As a guide, the American College 
of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends that calorie levels never drop below 1200 calories per day 
for women or 1800 calories per day for men. Even these calorie levels are quite low.


EXERCISE SUGGESTIONS
-----------------------

1. Strength Training — 1 Hour — 3 Days Per Week
   What to do:
	1) Compound lower-body exercise (e.g. deadlift, squat)
	2) Upper-body superset: Upper-body pushing exercise (e.g. dumbbell bench press, push-up) 
	   & upper-body pulling exercise (e.g. single-arm bent-over row, dumbbell curl)
	3) Lower-body/core superset: Unilateral lower-body move (e.g. reverse lunge, step-up) 
	   & core move (e.g. plank, Russian twists)
	4) Metabolic finisher
	
2. High-Intensity Interval Training — 20 Minutes — 1 Day Per Week
   What to do:
   	Choose an activity you like as a template—maybe it's running, cycling, or bodyweight moves. 
   	Whatever it is, push as hard as you possibly can for 30 seconds, then back off for a rest period. 
   	How long you rest will depend on your fitness level. If you’re just starting, you may want to try 
   	a 2-to-1 rest-to-work ratio. Then you can reduce your rest time every week. You could also try 
   	Tabata intervals once you get comfortable—that’s 20 seconds of extremely hard work to 10 seconds 
   	of rest. Repeat that work/rest circuit until your 20 minutes are up.
   	
3. Steady-State Cardio — 35 to 45 Minutes — 1 Day Per Week
   What to do:
	Whatever you want! Running, rowing, swimming, hiking, kayaking...the list goes on.
	
4. Active Recovery — 2 Days Per Week
	Two days out of your week will be active recovery days—this is when your body has a chance to rest 
	up and rebuild muscle fibers that you’ve been tearing during your workouts (this is where you really 
	get stronger).
